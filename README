This is a small tutorial on how to use the StringFingering application.

To open a score, use the File menu. If you want to use anchors, do not forget to put Anchors On. 

To go through the Score, use the right and left arrows under the Score. To clean up boards, either double-click on one (which will remove all at its right) or
go to the Boards menu to Clear Panels. 

To use the numerous Panels to go through followed fingerings (a trail), either use the Extend button or right-click on the right arrow. This will let fingerings as they are,
and enable to move on. Note that extend will try to keep the current fingering so that it is coherent; if it cannot, it will go to a coherent trail, and notice you
of the change. 

The deeper arrows are there to go to the Start or End of the Score. 

Clcik Solve to Extend repeatedly as much as you can.

NOTE: For the arrows, one you click on an arrow, you can use the keyboard arrows to parse easily. Note that this uses focus; the keyboard arrows will work for 
the last set of arrows used, be it in the Score or the Control Panel.
